          What is Arbitrage Trading?

          <p>It's simply buying and selling, with the aim of making profit.</p>
          <p>
            For instance, if an asset is priced lower on one exchange and higher
            on another, smart traders can swoop in, buy it where it's cheaper,
            and then sell it where it's more expensive, making some profit.

              The Challenges of Manual Arbitrage Trading
            </b>
          </p>
          <p>
            Embarking on manual arbitrage trading is like navigating a bustling
            market blindfolded. The fast-paced nature of financial exchanges
            means that prices fluctuate in the blink of an eye. This can lead to
            missed opportunities and, worse, potential losses for traders
            attempting to execute trades manually.
          </p>
          <p>
            Moreover, it demands an extraordinary level of vigilance and swift
            decision-making skills. Traders need to constantly watch multiple
            exchanges, calculate price differences, and execute trades promptly.
            It's a tiring, time-consuming process that can often lead to
            exhaustion and lower returns.
